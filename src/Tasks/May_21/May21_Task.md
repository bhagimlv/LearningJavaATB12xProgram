Prepare the Below Questions Answer and post the same Answer in this post Comment Section.

**Q.1 What is Java?**
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to 
have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

5. Platform Independent
6. Portable
7. Robust
8. Dynamic
9. Secure
10.High Performance.
11.Multithreading.

**Q.3 What is JDK? and its component?**
The JDK is a software development environment used to develop Java applications and applets. 
It is a full-featured software development kit (SDK) for Java.
 **Components of JDK**
1. JRE (Java Runtime Environment): It provides the libraries, JVM, and other components to run Java applications.
2. JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Executes Java bytecode. Itâ€™s platform-dependent, but Java programs are platform-independent because of JVM.
3. Development Tools:	Tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications (e.g., javac, java, javadoc, jdb).
4. Java Compiler (javac)	:Converts Java source code (.java) into bytecode (.class).
5. Java (java):	Launches the JVM to run Java bytecode.
6. Debugger (jdb): Helps debug Java programs.
7. JavaDoc (javadoc)	:Used to generate documentation from Java source code comments.
8. Archiver (jar)	: Packs related class files into a single archive file (.jar).
9. Other Tools	Such as javap, jconsole, jstat, etc., for diagnostics and performance monitoring.

**Q.4 Is JVM platform-independent?**
No, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is not platform-independent; it's platform-dependent,
we have to install jvm as per our system configuration.

**Q.5 What is the difference between JDK and JRE?**
The main difference between JDK (Java Development Kit) and JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is their
purpose: JDK is for developing Java applications, while JRE is for running them. 
The JDK includes the JRE, along with additional tools like the Java compiler and debugger, 
which are necessary for creating and building Java applications. The JRE, on the other hand, 
provides the environment and resources needed to execute Java programs
