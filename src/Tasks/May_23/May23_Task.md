# **ðŸ“Œ Task 23-May | Core Java**
Prepare the Below Questions Answer and post the same Answer in this post Comment Section.

1) What is Source Code?
- Human understandable code written using High Level Programming language following the programming 
- language syntax and rules

2) What is Byte Code?
- Bytecode is an intermediate, low-level representation of source code that is compiled and optimized for execution by a 
- virtual machine (e.g., JVM in Java).
- It is not directly readable by humans or machines but is platform-independent and executed efficiently by interpreters or 
- just-in-time compilers.

3) What is the native code?
- Once the byte code is given to the jvm , jvm convert the byte code to native code depends on the os and configuration of the user system 
- Code which NATIVE to the OS.
- Windows -NC -on window( .exe), dmg(mac), sh - linux


4) What is Java Compiler?
Java compiler will understand the source code and convert the source code to bytecode at a time 

5) What is JIT Compiler?
   JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler is a part of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
   that improves the performance of Java applications by compiling bytecode into native machine code at runtime.

6) Difference between Compiler and interpreter?
   Compiler: Translates all code at a time â†’ then runs it (faster runtime).
   Interpreter: Translates as it runs line by line â†’ easier to debug.

   Compiler: javac compiles .java files into bytecode (.class).
   Interpreter (JVM): Interprets the bytecode or uses JIT to compile it to machine code during runtime.
