**Task 1:** -Done
The ternary operator and let me know if I give you a number. 
Let me know if it is even or odd.

**Task 2:** -Done
Use the ternary operator, nested ternary operator. 
If we have three numbers, N1, N2, and N3, give me the maximum between the three numbers.

**Task 3:** -Done
Again, use the nested ternary. 
You have to figure it out if I am an adult, minor, or senior. 
What is the condition? The condition is very simple. 

If my age is greater than 18, then I can be minor or adult or senior. 
But if my age is greater than 65, then I am a senior.
If I am between 18 to 65, then I am an adult.
