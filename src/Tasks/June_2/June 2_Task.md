**📌  Task 2-June. | Core Java**
Prepare the Below Questions Answer and post the same Answer in this post Comment Section.

1) **What is Git and GitHub?**
   **Ans:**
   GIT allows developers worldwide to use and modify it as an open-source tool, 
 making it a powerful collaborative tool that facilitates teamwork and innovation. 
 The “GIT” full form is “Global Information Tracker,” highlighting its ability to track code changes and maintain 
a comprehensive history of modifications.

GitHub is a web-based platform and cloud-based service that allows developers to store and manage code,
and track and control changes to their code. It's a social coding platform, meaning it facilitates collaboration 
and communication among developers. GitHub uses Git, an open source version control software, to manage code changes.

Git (global information tracker) is a version control system that is followed by github.
Git maintains local code reposiories and changes made by the user in the local systeam while github maintains online code repos to keep
the code avaialble to the team or people who are working on the same application development.

**2) Difference Between Git and GitHub?**
**Ans:**
 Git is a free, open source version control tool that developers install locally on their personal computers, 
while GitHub is a pay-for-use online service built to run Git in the cloud. 
Git is a piece of software. GitHub is an online SaaS service.

**3) explain the flow/Structure of the java Programs.**
   **Ans:**
The structure can be defined in 3 steps: 
Source Code File Structure (.java file)
Compilation and Execution Flow(source code .java>compilation byte code > native code)
Program Execution Flow (Logical Flow within the code)

_Source Code File Structure (.java file)_
Key Points for Source Structure:
Package: Organizes classes.
Import: Brings in pre-written code from other packages.
Class: The fundamental building block. It's a blueprint for objects.
Fields: Variables that store data.
Constructors: Used to initialize new objects.
Methods: Define actions or behaviors.
main method: The special method where program execution starts for standalone applications.

_Compilation and Execution Flow(source code .java>compilation byte code > native code)_
Writing Code,Compilation
Execution
* Loading
* VerifyingInterpreting/JIT Compiling:
* Running
Mnemonic: Source Code (.java) --javac--> Bytecode (.class) --java (JVM)--> Running Program

_Program Execution Flow (Logical Flow within the code)_
Entry Point,Sequential Execution,Control Flow Statements,Conditional Statements: like Looping Statements and Branching Statements,
Method Calls , Object Creation and Interaction,Exception Handling,Program Termination

4) Is it possible to execute Java program without having JDK in machine?
   **Ans:**
   JRE is enough to run/execute java program but if we want to develop and write programs then defintiely jdk is required.
   Anyway if the user is ide as intellij, we have one option to select the jdk while creating a project

5) Can I install multiple JDK or JRE  my machine?
**Ans:** 
  yes , we can install multiple JDKS and JREs on same machine which are having different types of version numbers
   Each time you start a Java application, a new instance of the JVM is created, running independently of others.
